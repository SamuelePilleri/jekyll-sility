        <title>Entry to IT-BHU(Currently IIT(BHU) Varanasi)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
21st July 2008 My entry to IT-BHU to study Integrated Dual Degree in Pharmaceutics. First time i was out of my state and 
landed into a feeling of complex new environment. Even though i was able to understand hindi, but when i spoke hindi with obvious mistakes environment sometimes filled with humour or anger in the opposite person.
Coming to english Speaking... I was good in english but not fluent enough and it was unavoidable thing that i can't speak english with gatekeepers and autorickshaw pullers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
